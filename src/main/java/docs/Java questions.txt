customer - id,name,location,address,contact,email,noOfEmployees,mobileno

1,jondoe
2,jane
3,bob

product - id,name,color,length,width,height,vendor,price,discount,category

1,bat,200$
2,ball,55$
3,gloves,20$

order - id,productid,customerid,vendor,price,address

1,1,1
2,1,2
3,1,1



that shows all customers and their order amount


select * from customers c, order o, product p
  where o.productid




book, bkoo, oobk
ifExists(facebook, book)
ifExists(facebook, bkoo)
4


Boobook, bkoo


ifExists(str1, str2)
ifAnagram(string, string)

that shows all customers and their order amount


class Anagarams{


    static boolean isAnagram(String mainString, String subString){

     ifExists(mainString,subString){
      return true;
      }
    }


    static boolean ifExists(String mainString, String subString){


        if()


    }



   public static void main(String args[]){

     Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
     Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);


     String mainString = sc.nextLine();
     String[] subStrings = sc.nextLine();

      for(String subString: subStrings){
         boolean result = isAnagram(mainString, subString);

         if(result){
           System.out.println(subString + "is anagram")
         }


      }


   }
}

       for(String s : subStrings){

          subChar = s.toCharArray();

          for(Char sub: subChar){

            int count = 0;

             for(Char main:mainChar){

                if(main == sub ){

                 count++;
                }

                if(count == sub.lenght){
                   System.out.println(s+ "is anagram")
                }

             }



          }





       }
